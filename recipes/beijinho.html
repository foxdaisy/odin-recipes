        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> 
            Beijinho ("little kiss" in Portuguese) is another beloved Brazilian sweet treat, often served at celebrations and gatherings. 
            This treat is creamy and rich, with a delicate coconut flavor that balances the sweetness of the 
            condensed milk.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>14 oz of sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 cup of unsweetened, shredded coconut</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>20 whole cloves for decorating (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the condensed milk, the butter, 1/2 cup of the coconut and the cream 
                to a medium sauce pan and place it over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>Cook, stirring repeatedly, until you scrape the bottom of the pan, and the mixture takes 3

            <li>Pour onto a plate and let it cool.</li>
            <li>Butter your hands and shape the fudge into balls.</li>
            <li>Roll the balls on the remaining shredded coconut.</li>
            <li>Insert a whole clove to each ball to decorate (remove the clove before eating).</li>
